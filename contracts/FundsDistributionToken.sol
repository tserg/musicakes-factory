 * fee or revenue shares among large numbers of token holders. Anyone can deposit funds, token holders can withdraw
 * their claims.
 * FundsDistributionToken (FDT) implements the accounting logic. FDT-Extension contracts implement methods for depositing and
 * withdrawing funds in Ether or according to a token standard such as ERC20, ERC223, ERC777.
